I was the guy that knew just enough about technology to be totally intimidated.  I knew, to a limited degree, how to use a computer; I did not, however, know how computers worked.  This was my life and my relationship with technology, for quite some time, until I started grad school.  On my first day, first class, the professor looked out at the class and said, “You are going to have to learn how to code in this class.”  This terrified me.  My next class, Observational Techniques, was no improvement.  There the professor echoed my first professor’s sentiment.  “We work with different data types and specifically, images, and consequently, you are going to have to learn, if you don’t already know it, Python and how to manipulate fits files.  I, smiling nervously, did not know what my professor meant by either Python or a fits file.  And I was introduced to the first obstacle when one begins to learn to code: Understanding the coding idiom.  

For me, it was much like this: You have been tasked to interpret some newly discovered ancient text, written in a completely alien hieroglyphic.  You are assured you’ll be provided all the requisite resources needed to complete the task (I’m thinking about phython.org, as I write this.  Wonderful resource, by the way).  However, when you break open your first resource, you realize it is written in Latin.  Often, for me, initially, the explanations lead to needing more explanations.  But this is the process that is required, when discovering, as Dr. Richard P. Feynman would say, “The pleasure of finding things out.”  

So, I dove into learning Python.  Well, more accurately, it was like falling off the high-dive: Sure, I hit the pool, but there was nothing pretty or graceful about it.  Yet, as difficult as it was, I quickly realized the joy that comes when a line of code finally works.  I can remember being in my small, dank apartment, and yelling out with joy, when I got a function to accept an array of data for the first time.  In hindsight, I think I was hooked then.  

I also made some great friends along the way.  Another grad student who could intuit my pain, and was quite comfortable with coding, offered up his knowledge and his time.  He asked me, “Say Jim, how about we meet every Wednesday, at 11-oclock, at my desk?” If it wasn’t for Tony’s selfless offer, I’m not sure I would have made it through that first semester.  

The question was: “Why did you decide to learn software development?”  Two things became evident to me, during that first semester of grad school.  First, I can learn to code. It may be bumpy, and even hurt at times, but I can learn to code.  Second, this is the language spoken in the 21st century and it was important that I learn this language.  So, when I returned home after graduation, and while I began the painful process of job searching, I dove back in the pool (this time,  much more gracefully), and began the joyous journey of learning this beautifully, complex skill.
